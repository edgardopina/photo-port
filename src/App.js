//! This App.js file is the center of the application.
//! Think of App.js as THE ROOT COMPONENT or THE WRAPPER COMPONENT that houses all of the other components.
//* To effect any change on the application, we need to either modify this file or add components inside it.
//* React components follow the PascalCase naming convention. Knowing this will help you quickly identify
//* whether a function is a component or just a regular function.

//* we need to import React in every component file
import React, { useState } from 'react'; //* import React and React's state handler

import Nav from './components/Nav';
import About from './components/About';
import Gallery from './components/Gallery';
import ContactForm from './components/Contact';

   //* currentCategory - is the variable that will manage the state
   //* setCurrentCategory - the state variable (currentCategory) setter
   //* useState(par) : par - sets 'the initial value' of the state
